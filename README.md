# The I Am Poor Challenge :money_with_wings:

## Our Goal

Using what you have learnt from the I Am Rich app, you'll be building a simple Flutter app from scratch.

Using the Widget tree structure, create an app called I Am Poor, using everything you have learnt so far. Try to customise the app as much as you can to make it your own!

You can use your own images, or simply find one from the internet.

## What you will create

Now that you have been rich, itâ€™s time to join the 99%. This app will proudly display a lump of coal and the statement "I Am Poor"; the perfect app for when you get asked for money on the streets.
